## What to contribute
### Sprites
* Only commit sprites you created yourself.
* Only single sprites, we will (re)generate the spritesheets for you.
* Make sure your sprite is dividable by 32px on both axis.
* We generate our spritesheets in alphabetical order, would be nice if your new sprites are already named to take their place at the end of the list.
